# All networks are placed in /model/network_revised.py
# Use /model/create_model.py to create all models, including classifier training, reconstruction training and syn training.
# train_classifier.py is used to train classifier.
# recon.py is used to train reconstruction model
# train_syn.py is used to train syn model.
# syn_woE.py is used to train with frozen encoder
# iterTrain.py is used to train at the same iteration update encoder in reconstruction, update netG, netD at synthesize step.
